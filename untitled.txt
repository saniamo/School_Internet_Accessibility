Students Access to the Internet in Africa

The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced learning institutions to close and kept some 1.2 billion students worldwide out of the classroom, has worsened a pre-existing problem.

As children in the developed world have switched to online learning, the majority of pupils in Sub-Saharan Africa sit idle, frustrated and anxious, much to the dismay of parents and educators who are worried about their future.

Nearly 90 percent of students in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to household computers and 82 percent lack internet access. As a result, they cannot ensure educational continuity(UNESCO).

The inherent inequality with regards to access of the internet and other educational tools, threatens to deepen the global crisis when it comes to education(UNICEF).
